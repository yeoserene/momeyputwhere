    useful in one way or another.

	<p align="justify"> Its purpose is to help you easily and quickly visualize

	<h2 style="display: inline">Now, this is the estimated monthly interest (S$) you'll be getting.</h3>
    <br><h5 style= "display: inline">
	As we have mentioned before, and as a friendly reminder, this is purely just an estimated monthly amount 
          (total interest per year/12) which differs slightly from the computation done by banks as their interests 
          are computed on a daily basis.</h5>
    <br><br><h5 style="display: inline">
	There are guaranteed cashbacks on the credit cards that you use at various banks, that are EXCLUDED from
          this computation. This is because there are just too many different rebates schemes for all the available
          credit cards. For example, spending $500 on the UOB One card monthly gets you $200 annual interest but 
          this piece of information is not included in the figures presented to you below.</h5>
